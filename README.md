# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:

1.	WHAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING? 

Answer: Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It applies engineering principles to software creation to ensure that it is reliable, efficient, and maintainable. The primary goal of software engineering is to produce high-quality software that meets the needs and requirements of users while being delivered on time and within budget. 

2.	WHAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, AND HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM TRADITIONAL PROGRAMMING? SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC): 

Answer: Software Engineering is a systematic, disciplined approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, applying engineering principles to ensure software is reliable, efficient, and maintainable. Traditional Programming focuses primarily on coding and immediate problem-solving without the broader considerations of project management, design, testing, and maintenance inherent in software engineering.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used for developing software. It consists of several phases, including:
1.	Requirement Analysis: Determining the needs and conditions to meet for a new or altered product.
2.	Design: Planning the architecture and components of the software.
3.	Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code.
4.	Testing: Verifying the software works as intended.
5.	Deployment: Releasing the software for use.
6.	Maintenance: Updating and improving the software after deployment.


3.	EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS PHASES OF THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE. PROVIDE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EACH PHASE. AGILE VS. WATERFALL MODELS. 

Answer: Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1.	Requirement Analysis:
o	Description: Gather and analyze the requirements of the software from stakeholders. This phase involves understanding what the users need from the software, documenting requirements, and ensuring they are clear and complete.
2.	Design:
o	Description: Plan the architecture and design of the software. This includes defining the system architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data models. The goal is to create a blueprint for the development phase.
3.	Implementation (Coding):
o	Description: Write the actual code based on the design documents. This phase involves converting design into executable code using a suitable programming language.
4.	Testing:
o	Description: Verify that the software works as intended and is free of defects. This phase includes various levels of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
5.	Deployment:
o	Description: Release the software to the production environment where it will be used by the end-users. This phase involves installation, configuration, and ensuring that the system is operational.
6.	Maintenance:
o	Description: Update and improve the software after deployment. This includes fixing bugs, adding new features, and making modifications to adapt to changing user needs or environments.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 

Agile Model:
•	Description: An iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, customer feedback, and continuous improvement.
•	Key Features:
o	Iterative development in short cycles (sprints).
o	Frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans.
o	Close collaboration with stakeholders.
o	Emphasis on working software and customer satisfaction.

Waterfall Model:
•	Description: A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
•	Key Features:
o	Structured and rigid phase progression.
o	Requirements are defined at the beginning and changes are difficult to implement once the process has started.
o	Clear documentation and defined stages.
o	Easy to manage due to its rigid structure but less flexible to changes.


4.	WHAT IS REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING? DESCRIBE THE PROCESS AND ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE. SOFTWARE DESIGN PRINCIPLES: 
Answer: 
Requirements Engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. It involves understanding the needs and constraints of stakeholders and ensuring that the software meets these needs. This process is critical because it lays the foundation for the entire software development lifecycle, ensuring that the end product is both functional and meets user expectations.
Process of Requirements Engineering
1.	Elicitation:
o	Description: Gathering requirements from stakeholders through various techniques such as interviews, surveys, observations, and workshops.
o	Importance: Ensures that the requirements reflect the actual needs and expectations of users and stakeholders.
2.	Analysis:
o	Description: Examining and refining the gathered requirements to ensure they are complete, clear, consistent, and feasible.
o	Importance: Identifies potential conflicts and ambiguities, ensuring that requirements are well-understood and agreed upon by all parties.
3.	Specification:
o	Description: Documenting the requirements in a detailed and precise manner. This can include creating requirements documents, use cases, user stories, and functional specifications.
o	Importance: Provides a clear and unambiguous description of the software requirements, serving as a reference for design and development.
4.	Validation:
o	Description: Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect the needs of the stakeholders and that they are feasible and testable.
o	Importance: Confirms that the requirements are correct and complete, reducing the risk of costly changes later in the development process.
5.	Management:
o	Description: Handling changes to the requirements as they arise during the project. This includes tracking changes, maintaining version control, and ensuring that all stakeholders are aware of and agree to the changes.
o	Importance: Ensures that the project remains aligned with stakeholder needs and expectations despite changes and evolving requirements.
Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle
•	Foundation for Design and Development: Accurate requirements provide a clear roadmap for the design and development phases, reducing ambiguity and rework.
•	Improves Quality: Well-defined requirements lead to a product that better meets user needs and expectations, improving overall quality and user satisfaction.
•	Reduces Costs and Delays: Identifying and addressing requirements issues early in the lifecycle reduces the risk of costly changes and delays later in the project.
•	Facilitates Communication: Clear requirements documentation helps ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the software will do, facilitating better communication and collaboration.


Question 5: What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work
